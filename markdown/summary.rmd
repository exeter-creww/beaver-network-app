# Open Beaver Network (OBN) and Beaver Habitat Index (BHI)
### Data Summary

The OBN is a National scale river network model describing the suitability of 
beaver forage (Beaver Forage Index) and the capacity to support beaver dams 
(Beaver Dam Capacity Model). Additonal geomorphic, vegetation and Hydrological 
attributes are also available on download. Also provided is the Beaver Habitat 
Index (BHI) which is a gridded (raster) dataset that describes the suitability 
of beaver forage within 200m of the river network with a resolution of 10 m. 

These data are derived according to the methods desscribed in 
<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10344-020-01379-w.pdf" target="_blank">Graham, et al. (2020)</a> 
as part of a partnership between the 
<a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/creww/" target="_blank">Centre for Resilience in Environment, Water and Waste</a> 
,at the University of Exeter, and 
<a href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/" target="_blank">The Wildlife Trusts</a>.


### Data Formats and Download:  

The OBN is a spatial vector dataset comprising > 1 million line geometries. It is 
available in either the GeoPackage format or ESRI shapefile. Both contained 
within a .zip folder. To use either simply extract the contained files and load 
with your preferred Geographic Information System (GIS). 

The BHI is a spatial Raster dataset with each pixel containing a value of 0-5, 
which describes the suitability of beaver forage. These data are provided at two 
different resolutions: 1 km and 10 m; both are provided in Cloud Optimised Geotiff
format. Geotiff is the most widely used raster format, readable by most GIS 
software; Cloud optimisation enables its use directly from the source URL for 
a range of software including GDAL and QGIS.
